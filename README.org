#+TITLE: pinang

* Description

  This is a package consisting of several small handy tools for analyzing
  biomolecule structures (protein, RNA, DNA) or MD trajectories.

  At the current stage, these tools are mainly used for analyzing /CafeMol/ MD
  results.


* Installation

  Please change compiler confirgurations in =src/Makefile=, then run

#+begin_src sh
make
make install
#+end_src

By default, all the tools will be moved to the =bin/= directory.

** Prerequisites

   The /Boost C++ Libraries/ are reqired.

* Dangerous Traps
** PDB format
   - DNA residues should have name "DA", "DT", "DC", or "DG".
   - If the user want to include ions into CG models, change atom record name
     from "HETATM" to "ATOM".
