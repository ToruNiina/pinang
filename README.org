#+TITLE: pinang

* Description

  This is a package consisting of several small handy tools for investigating
  biomolecule structures (protein, RNA, DNA) or MD trajectories.


* Installation

  Please change compiler confirgurations in =src/Makefile=, then run

#+begin_src sh
make
make install
#+end_src

By default, all the tools will be moved to the =bin/= directory.

** Prerequisites

   The /Boost C++ Libraries/ are reqired.
